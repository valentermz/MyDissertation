 This work deals with \textit{generic} quadratic vector fields on $\C^2$ and the holomorphic foliations that these vector fields define on $\CP^2$. We assume that the extended foliation has non-degenerate singularities only and an invariant line at infinity.
 
 The first part of the present work deals with the \textit{extended spectra of singularities}. The extended spectra is the collection of the eigenvalues of the linearization of the vector field at each of the singular points in the affine part, together with the characteristic numbers (i.e.~Camacho-Sad indices) of the singularities on the line at infinity. We discuss what are the relations among these numbers that every generic quadratic vector field is bound to satisfy. Moreover, we conclude that two generic quadratic vector fields are affine equivalent if and only if they have the same extended spectra of singularities.
 
 In the second part we focus on the \textit{holonomy group} at infinity. We show that two generic quadratic vector fields that have conjugate holonomy groups must be orbitally affine equivalent. In particular, this proves that generic quadratic vector fields exhibit the utmost rigidity property: two such vector fields are orbitally topologically equivalent if and only if they are orbitally affine equivalent.

\chapter*{Preface}

The results presented in this thesis belong to the theory of \textit{holomorphic foliations}. More precisely, to the study of polynomial vector fields on $\C^2$ and the holomorphic foliations that such vector fields define on $\CP^2$. The theory of holomorphic foliations is a rich area of mathematics where several other branches of mathematics come together: ordinary differential equations, one-dimensional complex dynamics, complex analytic and complex algebraic geometry, singularity theory, topology. 

The origins of the theory of holomorphic foliations trace back to the beginning of the \textit{qualitative theory} of ordinary differential equations, pioneered by Poincar\'{e} towards the end of the XIX$^{\text{th}}$ century. 
%
%cit: H. Poincare, "Mémoire sur les courbes définiés par une équation différentielle" J. de Math--a series of papers between 1881 and 1886. cf. https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Qualitative_theory_of_differential_equations
%
The brilliant insight of Poincar\'{e} was that differential equations belong not only to the realm of analysis, but also to geometry. For example, providing a non-autonomous differential equation of the form $\displaystyle\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x,t)$ is equivalent to giving a vector field, a much more geometric object, of the form
 \[ v = f(x,t)\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial}{\partial t}, \qquad (x,t)\in U\subset\R^2, \]
in some appropriate open set $U$. A solution to the given differential equation corresponds to a smooth curve $s\mapsto\varphi(s)$ that is everywhere tangent to the vector field $v$. Under this philosophy, Poincar\'{e} made an exhaustive use of geometric methods to derive geometric properties of the solutions. Particularly, Poincar\'{e} set himself to study of systems of differential equations of the form 
\begin{equation}\label{preface:eq:1}
 \frac{dx}{dt}=P(x,y), \quad \frac{dy}{dt}=Q(x,y),
\end{equation}
where $(x,y)\in\R^2$ and $P,Q$ are real polynomials. To an autonomous equation such as (\ref{preface:eq:1}) we can associate a polynomial two-dimensional vector field $\displaystyle v=P(x,y)\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + Q(x,y)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$. Poincar\'{e} himself introduced the key concept of a \textit{limit cycle}: a closed trajectory (i.e.~periodic solution) isolated from other such trajectories, and proved that a polynomial differential equation in the plane with no saddle connections may only have a finite number of limit cycles.

In 1900, during the International Congress of Mathematicians, Hilbert included in his famous list of problems the following question:

\bigskip
\begin{quote}
\singlespacing
 What can be said about the maximal number and position of Poincar\'{e} boundry cycles (\textit{cycles limites}) for a differential equation of the first order of the form $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{Q}{P}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are $n^{\text{th}}$ degree polynomials in $x$ and $y$?
\end{quote}

\noindent This question, which is the second part of Hilbert's $16^{\text{th}}$ problem, remains open--even in the simplest non-trivial case: that of quadratic polynomials.

The study of \textit{complex} vector fields goes back to Poincar\'{e} and Dulac, yet a huge development took place towards the end of the 1950's, when Russian mathematicians Petrovskii and Landis published a paper claiming to have a complete solution to Hilbert's $16^{\text{th}}$ problem \cite{PetrovskiiLandis1957}. The strategy in this paper is to extend equation (\ref{preface:eq:1}) to the complex domain. In such extension the solutions to the equation define, outside the set of equilibrium points
 \[ \Sigma = \set{(x,y)\in\C^2}{P(x,y)=Q(x,y)=0}, \]
complex analytic curves locally parametrized by a complex variable $t\in\C$. In this way, the solutions decompose $\C^2\setminus\Sigma$ into a disjoint union of curves. Moreover, by the flow-box theorem, this partition locally looks like the standard partition of the bidisk $\mathbb{D}\times\mathbb{D}$ by parallel horizontal slices $\mathbb{D}\times\{y\}$. These are precisely the defining properties of what we know as a \textit{singular holomorphic foliation}. The integral curves of the equation are called the \textit{leaves} of the foliation and $\Sigma$ its \textit{singular set}. Many of the concepts in the theory of real differential equations have a straightforward complex analog. In particular, the concept of a limit cycle can be naturally extended to the complex domain. The Petrovskii-Landis strategy consisted of bounding the number of complex limit cycles that may appear in the \textit{complexification} of equation (\ref{preface:eq:1}), thus obtaining a bound on the number of real limit cycles. 

In the middle of the 1960's Ilyashenko and Novikov found a crucial gap in the solution to Hilbert's $16^{\text{th}}$ problem, which completely invalidated the results claimed by Petrovskii and Landis. The history of this still-open problem has certainly been dramatic, yet it has inspired a great development in the geometric theory of differential equations and marked a start point for the study of complex polynomial foliations on $\C^2$.

A crucial further development of the theory was later achieved by Hudai-Verenov and Ilyashenko \cite{HudaiVerenov1962,Ilyashenko1978}, who proved that the \textit{generic} properties of complex polynomial foliations are strikingly different than those of real polynomial foliations. In particular, generic polynomial foliations have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,noitemsep]
 \item Rigidity: Topological equivalence is extremely rare and closely related to analytic equivalence.
 \item Density of solutions: Every leaf on $\C\setminus\Sigma$ is everywhere dense on $\C^2$.
 \item Infinite amount of limit cycles: There are countably many homologically independent complex limit cycles.
\end{itemize}
The meaning of the word ``generic'' above is something that has been refined thanks to many authors throughout the years (eg.~\cite{Shcherbakov1984,Nakai1994,LinsNetoSadScardua1998}) and is now taken to mean that there exists an open and dense set in the space of all polynomial foliations of a fixed degree (defined by either algebraic or analytic conditions) where every foliation from that set satisfies the above properties.

\bigskip
\noindent There are two main contributions of this thesis to the theory of polynomial vector fields on $\C^2$.

First, improving on previous results, we show that foliations defined by generic quadratic vector fields have the strongest imaginable rigidity property.

\begin{prefthm}
Two foliations defined by generic quadratic vector fields are topologically equivalent if and only if they are affine equivalent.  
\end{prefthm}

Second, we provide two completely independent results that provide necessary and sufficient conditions for generic quadratic vector fields to be affine equivalent. Previously, no results of this sort were known. %Double check this claim!! haha..

\begin{prefthm}
 Two generic quadratic vector fields are orbitally affine equivalent if and only if their holonomy groups at infinity are analytically conjugate.
\end{prefthm}

\begin{prefthm}
 Two generic quadratic vector fields are affine equivalent if and only if they have the same spectra of singularities and the same characteristic numbers at infinity.
\end{prefthm}

These results have been published in \cite{TwinVectorFields,UtmostRigidity} and will be discussed in detail in the present work.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{The class of generic quadratic vector fields}

The object of study in this work are \textit{quadratic vector fields} on $\C^2$. These are sections of the holomorphic tangent bundle of $\C^2$ of the form 
 \[ v = P(x,y)\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + Q(x,y)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \]
where $P,Q\in\C[x,y]$ are polynomials of degree two. Let us regard $\C^2$ as an affine chart on $\CP^2$. A vector field $v$ as above does not have a holomorphic extension to $\CP^2$, since it is known that any holomorphic vector field on $\CP^2$ comes from a linear homogeneous vector field on $\C^3$. Nonetheless, the \textit{holomorphic foliation} that the integral curves of $v$ define on $\C^2$ can always be extended to a singular holomorphic foliation $\F_v$ on $\CP^2$. Such extension is possible for any polynomial vector field on $\C^2$. Conversely, any singular holomorphic foliation on $\CP^2$ is induced by a polynomial vector field on any affine chart.

The space of polynomial vector fields of a fixed degree has a natural vector space structure. We seek to understand the \textit{generic properties} of such vector fields. We will say that a property is generic if it is satisfied by every vector field in some open and dense subset of the space of all vector fields of the given degree. The nature of these open and dense sets will be specified when needed. For example, by Bezout's theorem, a generic vector field of degree $n$ has exactly $n^2$ isolated singularities. Also, it is well known that when extending a foliation from $\C^2$ to $\CP^2$ we generically obtain an invariant line at infinity. This means that the line $\mathcal{L}=\CP^2\setminus\C^2$, once a finite number of singularities are removed, is a leaf of the foliation $\F_v$. In the generic case, the number of singularities on $\mathcal{L}$ is exactly $n+1$. These conditions are the most basic generic properties of polynomial vector fields, they are all defined by algebraic conditions and, we will deal exclusively with quadratic vector fields with these properties. 

\begin{definition}\label{def:classesV2A2}
 We will denote by $\V_2$ the space of all quadratic vector fields $v$ on $\C^2$ having exactly 4 isolated singularities, and such that $\F_v$ has an invariant line at infinity with exactly 3 singular points. Also, we will denote by $\A_2$ the space of all \textit{foliations} that come from a vector field from the class $\V_2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{rmk:scalingFactor}
 Two polynomial vector fields of equal degree generate the same foliation if and only if they differ only by a non-zero scaling factor; hence, $\A_2$ is given by the quotient $\V_2/\C^*$.
\end{remark}




\section{Equivalence of vector fields and foliations}

The properties we aim to study should not only be generic, but should also be preserved under  analytic (or topological) equivalence. We consider three types of relations: equivalence of vector fields over $\C^2$, orbital equivalence of vector fields over $\C^2$, equivalence of foliations over $\CP^2$. The following definitions are standard.

\begin{definition}\label{def:analyticEqVectorFields}
 We say that two vector fields $v_1$ and $v_2$ are \textit{analytically equivalent} if there exists an analytic diffeomorphism $F$ 
 %between the respective ambient spaces 
 that transforms one into the other; that is, $v_2(p)=DF(F^{-1}(p))\cdot v_1(F^{-1}(p))$. In case the diffeomorphism $F$ is an affine transformation on $\C^2$, we will say that the vector fields are \textit{affine equivalent}. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:analyticEqFoliations}
 Let $\F_1$ and $\F_2$ be singular holomorphic foliations on a complex manifold $M$. We say that $\F_1$ and $\F_2$ are \textit{topologically equivalent} if there exists a homeomorphism  of $M$ which brings the leaves of $\F_1$ onto the leaves of $\F_2$ while preserving both the orientation of the leaves and of ambient space $M$. If such homeomorphism is in fact an analytic diffeomorphism, we will say that the foliations are \textit{analytically equivalent}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:orbitalEq}
 Two vector fields on $\C^2$ will be said to be \textit{orbitally} equivalent if the singular holomorphic foliations they define are equivalent over $\C^2$ in the respective sense (topological or analytic).
\end{definition}




\vspace{-1.5\parskip}
\section{Analytic invariants of polynomial vector fields}

By \textit{analytic invariants} of a vector field we mean those \textit{objects} that we can coherently associate to each (say generic) vector field which are preserved under analytic equivalence. These objects may be numbers, groups, cohomology classes, sheaves, and so on. Good analytic invariants should give us valuable information about the behavior of the vector field in question. Moreover, these invariants are fundamental in the understanding of the \textit{analytic classification} of vector fields: in order for two vector fields to be analytically equivalent, it is necessary that their invariants should coincide. The question of whether or not coincidence of the invariants is also sufficient is, in most cases, a delicate question. 

Analytic invariants can be of a different nature: local, semi-local or global. For example, the \textit{projective degree} of a foliation (the number of tangencies with a generic line) or the set of invariant algebraic curves are global analytic invariants. For the class of generic quadratic vector fields these invariants are not interesting: a quadratic vector field with an invariant line at infinity has always projective degree two, and in the generic case no other invariant curves. The analytic invariants we are interested here are of a local nature: the spectra of the singularities; and semi-local: the holonomy group at infinity.


\subsection{The spectra of singularities}

Let $p$ be an isolated singular point of some vector field $v = P(x,y)\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + Q(x,y)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$. Consider the \textit{linearization matrix}
 \[ Dv(p) = 
 \renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{0.65}
  \begin{pmatrix} 
   P'_x & P'_y \\
   Q'_x & Q'_y \\
  \end{pmatrix}\bigg\vert_{(x,y)=p\,.}  
   \]
It is well known that analytically equivalent vector fields have conjugate linearization matrices, hence the spectrum of the linearization matrix at each singular point is an analytic invariant.

\begin{definition}
 Let $p$ be a singular point of $v$. We define the \textit{spectrum} of $v$ at $p$ as the ordered pair $\operatorname{Spec}\,(v,p) = (\tr Dv(p),\det Dv(p))$. The \textit{spectrum of singularities} of $v$ is the set 
  \[ \operatorname{Spec}\,v = \set{\operatorname{Spec}\,(v,p)}{v(p)=0} . \]
\end{definition}


\subsection{Characteristic numbers}

In order to study the extended foliation in a neighborhood of the line at infinity we introduce the following change of coordinates: $z=\displaystyle\frac{1}{x}$, $w=\displaystyle\frac{y}{x}$. A simple computation shows that, in these coordinates, a generic quadratic vector field induces a foliation given by an equation of the form
 \[ \frac{dz}{dw} = z\sum_{j=1}^3 \frac{\lambda_j}{w-w_j} + O(z^2). \]
The line at infinity is given by $\mathcal{L}=\{z=0\}$, and the singular point on it correspond to the poles $w_j$. The \textit{characteristic numbers at infinity} are defined to be the residues $\lambda_j$, which are precisely the Camacho-Sad indices $\lambda_j=\operatorname{CS}\,(\F_v,\mathcal{L},w_j)$.%
% Clearly, each residue is a local analytic invariant%
% %
% \footnote{It can be shown that under rigidity of the holonomy group, which is a generic condition, the collection $\{\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3\}$ is in fact a global topological invariant of $\F_v$ \cite{Ilyashenko1978,IlyashenkoMoldavskis2011}.}.

\begin{definition}\label{def:extendedSpectra}
 The \textit{extended spectra of singularities} of a generic quadratic vector field $v$ is the collection of the spectra of singularities over the affine part, together with the characteristic numbers at infinity.
\end{definition}


\subsection{The holonomy group}

Let $\F$ be a foliation from the class $\A_2$ and denote by $\LF$ its leaf at infinity (i.e.~the line punctured at the singularities). Given a base point $b\in\LF$ and the germ of a cross section $(\Gamma,b)$, transversal to the leaves of $\F$, we can perform the following standard construction: for any loop $\gamma$ on $\LF$ based at $b$, we follow the leaves of $\F$ along some small tubular neighborhood of the image of $\gamma$ to obtain the germ of a holomorphic return map $\Delta_\gamma\colon (\Gamma,b)\to(\Gamma,b)$. This germ, the \textit{holonomy} of $\F$ along $\gamma$, depends only on the homotopy class of $\gamma$ in the fundamental group $\pi_1(\LF,b)$. Moreover, the map $\Delta\colon\pi_1(\LF,b)\to \operatorname{Diff}\,(\Gamma,b)$ is a group anti-homomorphism. Fixing an analytic parametrization $\Diff\to \operatorname{Diff}\,(\Gamma,b)$, we will write $\Delta\colon\pi_1(\LF,b)\to\Diff$ and define the \textit{holonomy group at infinity} of $\F$ as $\GF=\operatorname{Im}\,\Delta\subset\Diff$. This group is canonically defined up to conjugacy in $\Diff$.

\begin{definition}
 We say that two foliations $\F$ and $\Ft$ from the class $\A_2$ have \textit{analytically conjugate holonomy groups} whenever there exist the germ of a conformal map $h$, and a geometric isomorphism $H_{\ast}\colon \pi_1(\LF,b)\to\pi_1(\LFt,\tilde{b})$ that conjugate the holonomy in the following way:
  \[ \forall\gamma\in\pi_1(\LF,b): \quad %
     h\circ\Delta_\gamma = \widetilde{\Delta}_{H_{\ast}\gamma}\circ h. \]
By a \textit{geometric isomorphism} we mean an isomorphism $H_{\ast}\colon \pi_1(\LF,b)\to\pi_1(\LFt,\tilde{b})$ induced by some orientation-preserving homeomorphism $H\colon\LF\to\LFt$.
\end{definition}

The holonomy group at infinity has been the main tool in the study of generic polynomial foliations. It is known that a generic polynomial foliation on $\C^2$ has a holonomy group at infinity that is \textit{non-solvable}. Under the assumption of non-solvability and a few extra mild restrictions, the geometric properties of the holonomy group determine to a great extent the geometric properties of the foliation on a global level. A finitely generated non-solvable (pseudo) group of conformal germs $\Diff\to\Diff$ satisfies the following properties:
%
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,noitemsep]
 \item The group is \textit{topologically rigid} \cite{Shcherbakov1984, Nakai1994},
 \item The orbits of the action are \textit{dense in sectors} \cite{Nakai1994},
 \item The group has a countable number of germs whose representatives have \textit{isolated fixed points} different from zero \cite{BelliartLiousseLoray1997, ShcherbakovRosalesOrtiz1998}.
\end{itemize}
%
In consequence, a generic polynomial foliation satisfies the following:
%
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,noitemsep]
 \item The foliation is \textit{absolutely rigid}  \cite{Ilyashenko1978, Shcherbakov1984, LinsNetoSadScardua1998},
 \item The leaves of the foliation, except the leaf at infinity, are \textit{everywhere dense} in $\C^2$ \cite{HudaiVerenov1962,Shcherbakov1984},
 \item There exist a countable number of homologically independent \textit{complex limit cycles} \cite{ShcherbakovRosalesOrtiz1998,GoncharukKudryashov2017}. %SRO prove this only for n>2. Were Yury and Nataliya the first to prove it for n=2?
\end{itemize}

The concept of topological rigidity of polynomial foliations will be discusses in detail in Chapter \ref{chpt:holonomy}, where it will be shown that generic quadratic foliations have the strongest possible form of rigidity.




\section{Statement of the results}

There are two main results on this thesis. The first gives necessary and sufficient conditions for two generic quadratic vector fields to be analytically equivalent. This is done in two independent ways: Theorem \ref{thm:moduliSpectra} and Theorem \ref{thm:moduliHolonomy}. Second, we show in Theorem \ref{thm:utmost} that generic quadratic vector fields have the \textit{utmost rigidity property}.

Additionally, we prove a series of results that describe the extended spectra of singularities of generic quadratic vector fields (Theorems \ref{thm:twins}, \ref{thm:hiddenRelation}, \ref{thm:noIndexTheorem}).


\subsection{Moduli of analytic classification}

We present two sets of invariants that serve as moduli of analytic classification. It follows from Remark \ref{rmk:scalingFactor} that the passage from affine equivalence to orbital affine equivalence of polynomial vector fields of the same degree is straightforward: two vector fields $v_1$ and $v_2$ are orbitally affine equivalent if and only if there exists $\lambda\in\C^*$ such that $v_1$ and $\lambda v_2$ are affine equivalent.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{TwinVectorFields}]\label{thm:moduliSpectra}
 Two generic quadratic vector fields are affine equivalent if and only if their extended spectra of singularities coincide.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[\cite{UtmostRigidity}]\label{thm:moduliHolonomy}
 Two generic quadratic vector fields are orbitally affine equivalent if and only if their holonomy groups are infinity are analytically conjugate.
\end{theorem}

Genericity in the former theorem is defined by a (complex algebraic) Zariski open dense set in $\V_2$ whose existence is proved but not further described. The genericity assumptions on the latter theorem (as well as those for Theorem \ref{thm:utmost}) are discussed in detail in Chapter \ref{chpt:holonomy}


\subsection{The phenomenon of topological rigidity}

It was discovered in \cite{Ilyashenko1978} that polynomial foliations exhibit a phenomenon known as \textit{topological rigidity}. The idea of topological rigidity is that topological equivalence of foliations is extremely rare, and almost only happens when the foliations are, in fact, analytically equivalent. The main result in the paper cited is that a generic polynomial foliation is \textit{absolutely rigid}.

\begin{definition}
We say that a foliation $\F\in\A_n$ is \emph{absolutely rigid} if there exist a neighborhood $U$ of $\F$ in $\A_n$ and a neighborhood $V$ of the identity map in the space of self homeomorphisms of $\CP^2$ such that any foliation from $U$ which is conjugate to $\F$ by a homeomorphism in $V$ is necessarily affine equivalent to $\F$.
\end{definition}

The genericity assumptions in \cite{Ilyashenko1978} excluded a dense subset of $\A_n$. These assumptions have been substantially weakened over the years, and it is known now that every foliation in some open and dense subset of $\A_n$ is absolutely rigid ~\cite{Shcherbakov1984,Nakai1994,LinsNetoSadScardua1998}. The key assumption in the latest works is the non-solvability of the holonomy group at infinity. However, the necessity to restrict ourselves to a small neighborhood $U\subset\A_n$ and to assume proximity of the conjugating homeomorphism to the identity map were not dropped.

We prove here that the ideal paradigm of topological rigidity may be formalized for quadratic foliations: two generic foliations from the class $\A_2$ are topologically equivalent if and only if they are affine equivalent --no additional hypotheses are needed.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{UtmostRigidity}]\label{thm:utmost}
 Two generic foliations from the class $\A_2$ are topologically equivalent if and only if they are affine equivalent.
\end{theorem}

Note that non-solvable holonomy groups are topologically rigid, hence topologically equivalent generic foliations have analytically conjugate holonomy groups. For this reason, the above theorem is a direct consequence of Theorem \ref{thm:moduliHolonomy}. However, the question of rigidity was the motivating question that lead to Theorem \ref{thm:moduliHolonomy}.


\subsection{Twin vector fields}

Theorem \ref{thm:moduliSpectra} claims that the \textit{extended} spectra of singularities is a complete set of analytic invariants. A natural question is whether or not the \textit{finite} spectra of singularities (that is, the spectra of the singularities taken only over the affine part) determines completely the vector field (up to affine equivalence). The answer is no --generically, there are two disjoint orbits of the action of the group $\Aff{2}{\C}$ on $\V_2$ consisting of vector fields having the same finite spectra.

\begin{definition}\label{def:twins}
We will say that two vector fields $v_1$ and $v_2$ are \emph{twin vector fields} if they are not equal yet they have exactly the same singular locus and, for each point $p$ in the common singular set, the matrices $Dv_1(p)$ and $Dv_2(p)$ have the same spectrum.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[\cite{TwinVectorFields}]\label{thm:twins}
 A generic quadratic vector field has exactly one twin. Moreover, if two vector fields from the class $\V_2$ have the same finite spectra (no assumption on the position of the singularities) then, after transforming one of them by a suitable affine map, they are either identical or are a pair of twin vector fields.
\end{theorem}


\subsection{Relations on spectra and lack of new index theorems}

The extended spectra of a generic quadratic field consists of 11 complex numbers: 8 coming from the finite spectra and 3 characteristic numbers at infinity. These numbers are not independent, they are constrained by four classical \textit{index theorems}: 
\begin{align} 
 \sum_{v(p)=0}\frac{1}{\det Dv(p)} &= 0, \label{eq:EJ1}\\
 \sum_{v(p)=0}\frac{\tr Dv(p) }{\det Dv(p)} &= 0, \label{eq:EJ2}\\
 \sum_{p\in\operatorname{Sing }\F_v}\operatorname{BB}(\F_v,p) &= 16, \label{eq:BB}\\
 \sum_{p\in\mathcal{L}}\,\operatorname{CS}(\F_v,\mathcal{L},p) &= 1. \label{eq:CS}

These are, respectively, the Euler-Jacobi equations, the Baum-Bott theorem and the Camacho-Sad theorem. 

Let's do a simple dimension count: on one hand, the space $\V_2$ has dimension 12, and the affine group $\Aff{2}{\C}$ is 6-dimensional. Therefore the quotient (in the sens of Geometric Invariant Theory) $\V_2\sslash\Aff{2}{\C}$ has dimension 6. On the other hand, the extended spectra, which is of dimension 11, modulo the 4 equations above is a space of dimension 7. This gap in the dimensions implies that there must exist at least one more algebraic relation among these numbers. This \textit{hidden relation} was, until very recently, completely unknown. In order to describe this relation, let us introduce some notation.

Let $v\in\V_2$ have singularities $p_1,\ldots,p_4$ on $\C^2$ and singular points at infinity $q_1,q_2,q_3$. Denote by $(t_k,d_k)$ the spectrum of $v$ at $p_k$, and by $\lambda_j$ the characteristic number of $q_j$. Denote by $\Lambda$ the product $\Lambda=\lambda_1\lambda_2\lambda_3$, and define $S$ to be the graded polynomial ring $S=\C[t_1,\ldots,t_4,d_1,\ldots,d_4]$, where the generators $t_k$ are of degree 1, and $d_k$ of degree 2.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{NoIndexTheorems}]\label{thm:hiddenRelation}
 There exist symmetric polynomials $P_0,P_1,P_2\in S$, homogeneous (with respect to the grading of $S$) of degree 14, such that every generic quadratic vector field satisfies the following equation
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:hiddenRelation}
   P_2(t;d)\,\Lambda^2+P_1(t;d)\,\Lambda+P_0(t;d)=0 .
  \end{equation}
 Moreover, the above relation is independent from equations (\ref{eq:EJ1})--(\ref{eq:CS}).
\end{theorem}

In collaboration with Yuri Kudryashov, we obtained this equation using computer algebra software. The polynomial $P_2\Lambda^2+P_1\Lambda+P_0$ is irreducible, but it's expression is very long; it consists of approximately four-thousand monomials. Moreover, we have shown that this relation does not come from an index theorem. In fact, we show that any possible ``index-theorem-like equation'' can be deduced from the classical index theorems, hence concluding the lack of existence of new index theorems for quadratic vector fields.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{NoIndexTheorems}]\label{thm:noIndexTheorem}
 There exists no pair $(R,r)$ consisting of a rational function $R$ on $\C^8$ and a symmetric rational function $r$ on $\C^3$ with the property that every quadratic vector field with non-degenerate singularities satisfies the relation
  \[ R(t;d)=r(\lambda), \]
 except for those that can be derived from the previously known relations: Euler-Jacobi, Baum-Bott and Camacho-Sad.
\end{theorem}
